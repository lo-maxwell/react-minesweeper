# Minesweeper-Blog

## Day 1

### Set up a new app using Next.js + React

### Upload to git

### Build a Square Component

## Day 2

### Build a Board Component, and have it pass data down to the Squares


## TODO

### Fix Board, maybe make a 2d representation instead of 1d, right now it checks by wrapping around (and only works for 10 units)

### Update CSS using Tailwind to prettyify everything
